I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Let's have a little bit of fun today. In your world you can create anything you desire.

**This is your world, whatever makes you happy** you can put in it. Go crazy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You're meant to have fun in life.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. It's all a game of angles. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Let's get crazy. This is a fantastic little painting. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Have fun with it.

Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Be brave. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.

At home you have unlimited time. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
