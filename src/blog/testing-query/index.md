Poor old tree. Here's another little happy bush Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.

I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. See there how easy that is. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.

Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

And right there you got an almighty cloud. It takes dark in order to show light. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
