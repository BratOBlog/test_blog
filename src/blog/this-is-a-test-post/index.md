#ï»¿This is a test post

All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You are only limited by your imagination.

Just relax and let it flow. That easy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. This is truly an almighty mountain. Now then, let's play.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. There comes a nice little fluffer. Let your imagination be your guide. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. You gotta think like a tree. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.

Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You can create anything that makes you happy. This is the way you take out your flustrations.

You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. We don't have anything but happy trees here. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.

We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. There we go.

In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.
