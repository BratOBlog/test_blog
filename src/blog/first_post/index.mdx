**This is my first blog post! Isn't it *great*?**

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. You want your tree to have some character. 

# Make it special

Some of my **favorite** things are:
- Petting dogs
- Singing
- Eating potato-based foods

You need the dark in order to show the light. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.

All kinds of happy little splashes. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.

That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.

In your world you can create anything you desire. Let that brush dance around there and play. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Very easy to work these to death.

Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Let's do that again.

Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.

You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Have fun with it.
