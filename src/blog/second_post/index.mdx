# Here's another post! It's even better than the first one!

I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Take your time. Speed will come later.

It is a lot of fun. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.

In life you need colors. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We can fix anything. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

### It looks so good, I might as well not stop. 

Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Those great big fluffy clouds.

Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.

Brown is such a nice color. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.
