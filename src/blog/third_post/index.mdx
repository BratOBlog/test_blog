# Wow look at all this content. How do they do it?

All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. It's important to me that you're happy. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

Little short strokes. Anything you want to do you can do here. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.

> In painting, you have unlimited power.

>> You have the ability to move mountains. 

**The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it.**

Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. We don't have anything but happy trees here. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.

Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.

Every day I learn. It's all a game of angles. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. This is the fun part We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.
