# How do you make a round circle with a square knife?


That's your challenge for the day. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.

The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

**This painting comes right out of your heart.** And right there you got an almighty cloud. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. It is a lot of fun. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Poor old tree.

This is a fantastic little painting. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.

>You can do it. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

In your world you have total and absolute power. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Do an almighty painting with us.

Just relax and let it flow. That easy. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.
